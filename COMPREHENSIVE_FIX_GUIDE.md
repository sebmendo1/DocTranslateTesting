# Comprehensive Guide to Fixing the "Multiple commands produce" Error

This guide provides multiple solutions to fix the "Multiple commands produce '/path/to/Info.plist'" error in your Xcode project.

## Understanding the Problem

The error occurs because there are two sources trying to create the Info.plist file:

1. Your custom Info.plist file in the DocScannerTest directory
2. The automatically generated Info.plist from the INFOPLIST_KEY_* settings in the project file

Even though you've set `INFOPLIST_FILE` to point to your custom Info.plist, the project still has `INFOPLIST_KEY_*` settings enabled, which are used to generate Info.plist entries automatically. This causes a conflict during the build process.

## Solution 1: Remove INFOPLIST_KEY_* Settings

This solution removes the conflicting INFOPLIST_KEY_* settings from the project file.

### Automatic Method

Run the script:
```bash
./fix_infoplist_conflict.sh
```

### Manual Method

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Select the project in the Project Navigator (blue icon at the top)
3. Select the "DocScannerTest" target
4. Go to the "Build Settings" tab
5. Search for "scene manifest"
6. Set "Application Scene Manifest Generation" to "No"
7. Search for "launch screen"
8. Set "Launch Screen Generation" to "No"
9. Search for "supported interface"
10. Remove any values for "Supported Interface Orientations" settings
11. Clean and rebuild the project

## Solution 2: Rename Info.plist File

This solution renames your custom Info.plist file to avoid the conflict.

### Automatic Method

Run the script:
```bash
./fix_infoplist_conflict_alt.sh
```

### Manual Method

1. In Finder, navigate to your project folder
2. Go to the "DocScannerTest" folder
3. Rename "Info.plist" to "CustomInfo.plist"
4. Open the project in Xcode
5. Select the project in the Project Navigator
6. Select the "DocScannerTest" target
7. Go to the "Build Settings" tab
8. Search for "info.plist"
9. Change "Info.plist File" to "DocScannerTest/CustomInfo.plist"
10. Clean and rebuild the project

## Solution 3: Use an XCConfig File

This solution uses an XCConfig file to override the build settings without directly modifying the project file.

### Automatic Method

Run the script:
```bash
./fix_infoplist_with_xcconfig.sh
```

### Manual Method

1. Create a file named "InfoPlistFix.xcconfig" with the following content:
   ```
   // Disable automatic Info.plist generation
   GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = NO
   
   // Use our custom Info.plist file
   INFOPLIST_FILE = DocScannerTest/Info.plist
   
   // Disable other Info.plist related settings
   INFOPLIST_KEY_UIApplicationSceneManifest_Generation = NO
   INFOPLIST_KEY_UILaunchScreen_Generation = NO
   INFOPLIST_KEY_UIApplicationSupportsIndirectInputEvents = NO
   
   // Add a setting to disable the build warning
   DISABLE_MANUAL_TARGET_ORDER_BUILD_WARNING = YES
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Select the project in the Project Navigator
4. Select the "Info" tab at the top
5. Under "Configurations", click the "+" button and select "Duplicate Debug Configuration"
6. Name it "Debug-Fixed"
7. For the "Debug-Fixed" configuration, select the xcconfig file we created
8. Change the active scheme to use the "Debug-Fixed" configuration
9. Clean and rebuild the project

## Solution 4: Create a New Target

This solution creates a new target with fixed settings while keeping the original target intact.

### Instructions

Run the script for guidance:
```bash
./create_fixed_target.sh
```

Then follow the instructions to create a new target with the correct settings.

## Solution 5: Create a New Project

This solution creates a new project with clean settings while preserving your code.

### Instructions

Run the script for guidance:
```bash
./create_new_project.sh
```

Then follow the instructions to create a new project and copy your code.

## Solution 6: Add a User-Defined Setting

This solution adds a user-defined setting to disable the build warning.

### Manual Method

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Select the project in the Project Navigator
3. Select the "DocScannerTest" target
4. Go to the "Build Settings" tab
5. Click the "+" button at the top and select "Add User-Defined Setting"
6. Name it "DISABLE_MANUAL_TARGET_ORDER_BUILD_WARNING"
7. Set its value to "YES"
8. Clean and rebuild the project

## Recommended Approach

For most cases, Solution 1 (Remove INFOPLIST_KEY_* Settings) is the simplest and most effective approach. If that doesn't work, try Solution 3 (Use an XCConfig File) for a more maintainable solution.

If you continue to have issues, Solution 5 (Create a New Project) provides the cleanest slate but requires more manual work.

## Prevention for Future Projects

To prevent this issue in future projects:

1. Decide at the beginning whether you want to use a custom Info.plist file or let Xcode generate one automatically
2. If using a custom file, make sure to set `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = NO` in your build settings
3. If letting Xcode generate the file, don't create a custom Info.plist file
